# TODOLIST
- [X] restoring indentation when deleting lines/keeping indentation when pressing enter consecutively
- [ ] completion order (is mostly okay though) (lower letter start should give lower letter start in completion)
- [X] include inserts >> instead of > (no problem with auto-import though)
- [X] make result into quickfix list
- [ ] continue indent guides on blank lines using nvim_..._extmark(...)
- [X] switch indent guides on shiftwidth with autocommand on OptionsSet
- [ ] make luasnip jump behaviour understandable and maybe work with tab
